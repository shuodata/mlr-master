#' @param keep.pred [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Keep the prediction data in the \code{pred} slot of the result object.
#'   If you do many experiments (on larger data sets) these objects might unnecessarily increase
#'   object size / mem usage, if you do not really need them.
#'   In this case you can set this argument to \code{FALSE}.
#'   Default is \code{TRUE}.
