\title{Train an R learner.}
\usage{
trainLearner(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.learner}{[\code{\link{RLearner}}]\cr
Wrapped learner.}

\item{.task}{[\code{\link{Task}}]\cr
Task to train learner on.}

\item{.subset}{[\code{integer}]\cr
Subset of cases for training set, index the task with this.
You probably want to use \code{\link{getTaskData}} for this purpose.}

\item{.weights}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
Weights for each observation.}

\item{...}{[any]\cr
Additional (hyper)parameters, which need to be passed to the underlying train function.}
}
\value{
[any]. Model of the underlying learner.
}
\description{
Mainly for internal use. Trains a wrapped learner on a given training set.
You have to implement this method if you want to add another learner to this package.
}
\details{
Your implementation must adhere to the following:
The model must be fitted on the subset of \code{.task} given by \code{.subset}. All parameters
in \code{...} must be passed to the underlying training function.
}
